# linux commands tips #

- nohup command &

> The nohup at the beginning of command sends the output to the file ~/nohup.out instead of standard out. The & at the end of the command will allow the process to keep running in the background while giving you your prompt back for additional commands. To bring the process back to the front (back to the running process of the terminal), use the command fg at the same terminal.


- ps 显示进程不完全（ww无限显示）

	ps auxfww
